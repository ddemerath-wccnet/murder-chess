My name is Antionette and I'm new to programming. 
I'm currently learning C++ as my first language.
I have limited experience in VBA, Linux/Unix and HTML/CSS.
I have zero experience working on any sort of substantial project but I have an interest in game development as a hobby.
Other things I enjoy are hula hooping, League of Legends, Fortnite, RPG's, prog rock, camping, and climbing around in elevator shafts at work.
