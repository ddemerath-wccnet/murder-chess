My name is Donald Jackson, this is my last class that I'm taking for my Web Design & Development Associates.

Since I've worked primarily in the web classes, I'm not as experienced with coding as most of the people in the class probably are.

I've taken an introductory course on C++, the course on php and MySQL, and the javascript course.

My hope is to carry my weight as much as I can since I'll have to learn how many of of the tools we're using work.
