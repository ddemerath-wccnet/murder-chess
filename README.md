Hey, I'm Jeff. I work full time and I am going to WCC to get my Associate's in Computer Programming in C++ and I 
plan on continuing elsewhere with Computer Science into a Bachelor's degree; possibly focusing on Game Design. The 
classes at WCC have been my first real experience with C++ but I have used Java, Python, and Lua for making 
programs and games and I have used other languages to a lesser extent. I have worked on several personal projects 
for games both physical and digital; to varying degrees of completion. This project will probably be the first one 
I work on that I will end up calling 'complete'. I am taking this class to get more experience at working on projects 
with a group and to learn more about the different aspects of design and development as well as best practices 
with regards to that process. Some things about me: I like hockey and lacrosse, writing/worldbuilding, and DnD/Starfinder. I have 
a dog and two cats and I live in Florida. Looking forward to this semester!
