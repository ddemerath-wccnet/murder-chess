# Introduction

This Game Design Document (GDD) is intended to summarise the gameplay design and elements for 'Murder Chess'; a two-dimensional, 
top-down, rouge-like twist on Chess. At the time of first committing this document to GitHub, only the author has submitted writing
pertaining to the design and development of this game. It is intended that any and/or all colleagues freely submits their thoughts and 
ideas to this document as well. Everything written herein is not final. This is a living document and is meant to change over time. 

# Game Overview

In Murder Chess, the player will start off as a King and may become progressively stronger depending on their success as the game 
progresses. They begin play on a chessboard and, through numerous rounds, face off with hoards of enemy pieces; from Pawns to Queens. 
The player may be able to summon allied pieces or use special moves to help capture enemy pieces. Pieces may even have innate abilities
that occur naturally during play. 

# Gameplay Walkthrough

The game begins with a chessboard on screen. The player character, a King, spawns in central most light-coloured square on the lower side
of the board. Enemy pieces spawn across the board from the Player's piece. Now the Player may use the WASD (or Arrow Keys?) to move their 
piece. When the Player's movement finishes, the opposing pieces all move; one immediately after another. All of the pieces in the game 
follow the same general rules that they do in normal Chess. Importantly, the King may only move one square at a time and cannot move into 
check. The Player must manuever their King to capture each opposing piece in order to complete the round. Capturing enemy pieces could
provide a score or resource for the Player that they could then use to purchase upgrades or allied pieces. Purchases could be made at one
(or two?) shop(s) that would be located on the side(s) of the board. Rounds will become progressively harder until the Player reaches a 
Boss Round. These rounds would feature the King and Queen pieces on the opposing team and may have special rules active. The opposing King
and Queen could have special abilities like shockwave attacks or some kind of armour or evasive manouever. The game could be designed in
such a way to allow it to procedurally generate levels ad infinitum, but it might be better for the scope of this project to only include
a certain number of levels and, after completion, the game is over.

# Setting/Theme

This game will take place exclusively on a chessboard but there could be different themes applied to it that make the setting feel different. 
There is no story or story setting but a general theme or idea could be used to make a simple story. 

# Development

This section is meant to discuss the development plans for the game. What jobs need to be filled to complete this game? 

# Features

This section can be used to list features that are a part of the game or that we would like to add to the game. We can come up with some kind of
convention for differentiating between the two; like using different fonts or font sizes or italics/bold. Features will be separated into Core
Features (things that must be in the game to make it the game) and Extra Features (things that would be good additions to the core game).
